    <p>Hello everyone! I'm from the Philippines. I'm 35 years old, married, and have two children. I served my mission in the Philippines' San Pablo Mission. </p>
    <p>When the pandemic happened, my husband and I really needed to work from home, but I needed to have some skills to qualify for some job postings. I read a lot about programming and Python. And the BYU Pathway is a blessing for me because it helps me acquire skills in programming. I'm looking forward to improving myself in this field. I'm a first-timer in this field.</p>
